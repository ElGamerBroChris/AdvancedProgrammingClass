Crashing Robots

In a modernized warehouse, robots are used to fetch the goods. Careful planning is needed to ensure that the robots reach their destinations without crashing into each other. 
Of course, all warehouses are rectangular, and all robots occupy a circular floor space with a diameter of 1 meter. 
Assume there are N robots, numbered from 1 through N. You will get to know the position and orientation of each robot, and all the instructions, which are carefully (and mindlessly) followed by the robots.
Instructions are processed in the order they come.
No two robots move simultaneously; a robot always completes its move before the next one starts moving.

A robot crashes with a wall if it attempts to move outside the area of the warehouse, and two robots crash with each other if they ever try to occupy the same spot.
